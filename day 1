1. whats ur understanding of blockchain?
 ans = blockchain is like total data is decrypted which cant be easily accessed.

 2.  What is the core problem blockchain is trying to solve?
ans = no use of 3rd party services, the security is more so thats the transactions cant be easily identified

 3. what are the few features which blockchain will give u?
ans = 1. Verifiable
2. Unchangeable
3. Tamper proof
4. Immutable
5. Decentralized

What are all the things the block contains?
1. Block number.
2. Records.
3. Previous block signature.
4. Current Block signature
5. Mining Key

5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
The Blockchain can be verifiability by the data or the key which are stored in the distributed systems.
formula:-
Current Block Signature = Previous Block Signature + Data in the Block
ex: BlockData = Fingerprint1
Data1 + previous fingerprint1 = Fingerprint2
Data2 + previous fingerprint2 = Fingerprint3 and
data 3 + previous fingerprint3 = fingerprint 4
